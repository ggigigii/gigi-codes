## Welcome to my GitHub Page!

I am currently a graduate student pursuing my Masters in Economics at the University of Toronto in Toronto, Ontario. Recently having completed a Joint Honors in Economics and Finance from Simon Fraser University, pursuing a Masters degree seemed like the logical next step.

This website will be mainly used to present coursework detailing content covered in my wide array of field courses and core classes. You may find me on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gigilin0/).
